### Skin Optics Analysis using ISSA Data

[**JID_SkinOptics.html**](JID_SkinOptics.html) - Comprehensive analysis of skin optical properties using the International Skin Spectrum Archive (ISSA) dataset. This analysis examines:

- Melanin index (MI) and erythema index (EI) distributions across body sites
- First derivative spectral analysis for hemoglobin absorption features
- Peak-valley characteristics in derivative spectra
- Body site comparisons (forehead/cheek vs palm) using mixed-effects models
- Power-law relationships between melanin content and hemoglobin signal attenuation

Preprint forthcoming.
